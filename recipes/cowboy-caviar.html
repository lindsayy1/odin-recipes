        <h2 class="medium"> Description </h2> 
            <p> Cowboy caviar may be the perfect hot weather recipe because there is 100% no use of hot kitchen appliances. If you can get behind a little can opening and a fair amount of chopping, you can have a cool and satisfying summer dish. This recipe is perfect for the recipe-hater. Items can easily be swapped or removed entirely and measurement isn't mandatory either. Don't like bell pepper or corn? No need! Add something else like cucumber or even some mango or pineapple. </p>
            <p> The best part of cowboy caviar is the fact that it is essentially a hybrid between a salad and a salsa that you then get to eat with tortilla chips. I think we can all agree that any meal that you get to eat with chips is a pretty excellent one. </p>
