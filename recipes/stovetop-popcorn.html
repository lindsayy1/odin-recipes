        <h2 class="medium"> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul class="small">
                <li> 2 Tablespoons neutral flavored oil, avocado oil works well </li>
                <li> 1/2 cup popcorn kernels</li>
                <li> salt to taste </li>
                <li> some optional topping ideas: ranch seasoning, chili powder, cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, melted butter, nutritional yeast, etc </li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="medium"> Steps </h2>
            <ol class="small">
                <li> Heat the oil and 2 popcorn kernels in a large pot or sauce pan with a lid until the kernels pop. This should take about 3 minutes. Dutch ovens are perfect for making popcorn. </li>
                <li> Remove the pot from the heat and <em> carefully </em> add the remaining popcorn kernels. Replace the lid. Gently shake to coat the kernels in the hot oil. Let it sit for 60 seconds off the heat.</li>
                <li> Place the pot back on the stove at medium heat. Give the pot an occasional gentle shake to prevent burning. Once the kernels begin to pop, set the lid slightly ajar to let off steam. You do not want soggy popcorn. </li>
                <li> Continue cooking the popcorn over medium heat until the popping slows down to one pop every 2 - 3 seconds. If the popcorn starts to overflow tip some out into a bowl and keep cooking until popping slows.</li>
                <li> Once the popcorn is done cooking remove the lid and pour the popcorn into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with salt and add any additional toppings and seasonings. Toss and serve.</li>
