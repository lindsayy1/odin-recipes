        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Magic cookie bars are a delightfully rich dessert that is actually quick and easy to make. No blender or fancy equipment needed. Dump melted butter, graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, chocolate chips shredded coconut, and condensed milk in a baking dish and bake. No need for mixing, blending, or six thousand differnt bowls. Once you have made these delectable sweets a couple times you won't even need to measure, the recipe is very forgiving. Don't you love when a simple recipe is actually <em> simple</em>?</p>
        <p> The walnuts and coconut may seem like a hard sell for those pickier folks but douse anything in enough melted butter and condensed milk (basically just liquid sugar) and most people will eat just about anything. This recipe can easily be made dairy free by swapping butter for dairy-free margaraine sticks and using condensed coconut or oat milk in place of the condensed dairy milk. The walnuts could also be swapped for something like hulled sunflower seeds or pretzels. </p>
